# vohumana-gonetwork

Simple TCP client and server in Go, I would not use this in any production code anywhere.
- Needs way to expand single packet buffer
- Needs to detect client closing
- Client and Server client could be merged into one

Credit where credit is due: 
- Learned how the server could be implemented from: https://github.com/firstrow/tcp_server
